## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

The purpose of this analysis was to build a model that is capable of accurately classifying the creditworthiness of a potential borrower based on historical data.  Standard loan data was used as the input for the analysis including: loan amount, interest rate, income, debt, and derogatory credit history.  The output of the model was binary, either the borrower was categorized as creditworthy or high-risk.  The challenge in the data is striking the right balance to be sensitive enough to correctly identify high risk loans, but not so sensitive that healthy loans are declined costing the company revenue.  Additionally, because most loans are healthy, there is an imbalance in the data that could bias the model.  To counter this, two models were trained.  One model with the original data, and one model with resampled data to address the imbalance.  

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
